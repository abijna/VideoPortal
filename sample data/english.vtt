00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.340
so if you're in the audience today or

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.210
maybe you're watching this talk in some

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.519
other time or place

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.679
you are participant in the digital

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.589
rights ecosystem and whether you're an

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:30.599
artist a technologist a lawyer or a fan

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.740
the handling of copyright directly

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.719
impacts your life

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.450
now rights management is no longer

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.789
simply a question of ownership it's a

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.590
complex web of relationships in a

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:43.050
critical part of our cultural landscape

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.510
a YouTube cares deeply about the rights

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.370
of content owners but in order to give

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.520
them choices about what they can do with

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.410
copies mashups and and more we need to

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.199
first identify when copyrighted material

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.940
is uploaded to our site let's look at a

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.510
specific video so you can see how it

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.670
works

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.350
two years ago recording artist Chris

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.589
Brown released the official video of his

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.780
single forever a fan saw it on TV

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.689
recorded it with her camera phone and

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.939
uploaded it to YouTube now because Sony

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.970
Music had registered Chris Brown's video

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.710
and our Content ID system within seconds

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.140
of attempting to upload the video the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.840
copy was detected giving Sony the choice

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.140
of what to do next but how do we know

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.180
that the users video is a copy well it

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.579
starts with content owners delivering

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.770
assets into our database along with a

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.189
usage policy that tells us what to do

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.530
when we find a match we compare each

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.680
upload against all of the reference

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.360
files in our database now this heat map

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.189
is going to show you how the brain of

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.290
the system works here we can see the

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.890
original reference file being compared

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.659
to the user generated content the system

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.939
compares every moment of one to the

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.860
other to see if there's a match now this

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.630
means that we can identify a match even

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.430
if the copy uses just a portion of the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.130
original file plays it in slow motion

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.240
and has degraded audio and video quality

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.340
and we do this every time that a video

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.520
is uploaded to YouTube and that's over

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.980
20 hours of video every minute when we

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.280
find a match we apply the policy that

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.610
the

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.710
it's owner has set down and the scale

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.650
and the speed of this system is truly

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.710
breathtaking we're not just talking

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.860
about a few videos we're talking about

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.380
over a hundred years of video every day

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.209
between new uploads and the legacy scans

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.420
we regularly do across all of the

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.890
content on the site and when we compare

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.360
those hundred years of video we're

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.550
comparing it against millions of

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.480
reference files in our database it he'd

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.520
be like 36,000 people staring at 36,000

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.160
monitors each and every day without so

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.880
much as a coffee break now what do we do

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.920
when we find a match well most rights

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.870
owners instead of blocking will allow

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.330
the copy to be published and then they

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.940
benefit through the exposure advertising

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.930
and linked sales remember Chris Brown's

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.550
video forever

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.200
well it had its day in the Sun and that

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.360
had dropped off the charts and that

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.430
looked like the end of the story but

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.980
sometime last year a young couple got

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.580
married this is their wedding video you

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.580
may have seen it

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.659
what's amazing about this is if the

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:22.220
processional of the wedding was this

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:24.799
much fun can you imagine how much fun

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.480
the reception must have been I mean who

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.689
are these people I totally want to go to

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.849
that wedding so their little wedding

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:35.989
video went on to get over 40 million

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:38.390
views and instead of Sony blocking they

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.370
allowed the upload to occur and they put

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.670
advertising against it and linked from

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.310
it to iTunes and the song 18 months old

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.069
went back to number four on the iTunes

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.890
charts so Sony is generating revenue

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.329
from both of these and Jill and Kevin

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.470
the happy couple well they came back

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.200
from their honeymoon and found that

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.940
their video had gone crazy viral and

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.530
they ended up on a bunch of talk shows

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.299
and they used it as an opportunity to

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.879
make a difference the videos inspired

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.730
over $26,000 in donations to end

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:10.129
domestic violence and the JK wedding

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.290
dance became so popular that NBC

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:14.750
parodied it on the season finale of The

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.600
Office which just goes to show it's

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.370
truly an ecosystem of culture is it's

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.709
not just amateurs borrowing from big

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.949
studios but sometimes big studios

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.930
borrowing back by empowering choice we

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.000
can create a culture of opportunity and

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.349
all I took to change things around was

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.900
to allow for choice through rights

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:35.240
identification so why is no one ever

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.280
solved this problem before it's because

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.039
it's a big problem and it's complicated

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.229
and messy it's not uncommon for a single

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:45.500
video to have multiple rights owners

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:47.690
there's musical labels there's multiple

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.639
music publishers and each of these can

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.289
vary by country and there's lots of

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.180
cases where we have more than one work

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.599
matched together so we have to manage

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.770
many who claims to the same video

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.440
YouTube's Content ID system addresses

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.150
all of these cases but the system only

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.090
works for the participation of rights

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.650
owners if you have content that others

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.900
are uploading to YouTube you should

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.400
register in the Content ID system and

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.740
then you'll have the choice about how

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.539
your content is used and think carefully

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.090
about the policies that you attach to

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:19.669
that content by simply blocking all

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.970
reuse you'll miss out on new art forms

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:25.849
new audiences new distribution channels

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:28.500
and new revenue streams but it's not

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:30.810
just about dollars and impressions

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.430
just look at all the joy that was spread

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.010
through progressive rights management

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.080
and new technology I think we can all

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:40.580
agree that joy is definitely an idea

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.580
worth spreading thank you
